sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: By applying sort 1 to different txt files we see that the timer value drops on already sorted lists.
This is because the swap counter is not increasing and allows the algorithm to implicitly know that that the array is sorted.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: By applying sort 2 to different arrays, we see no significant deviation. The running time for merge sort is
always the same irrelevant of if the array is sorted or not. But the running time is faster than selection sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: We see no changes in runtime if we apply sort 3 on either which txt file. The running time is always higher
than the ones of merge sort.
